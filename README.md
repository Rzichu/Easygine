# Easygine
My old 2D engine on SFML - I've made it back in... 2023 I think. It was my first big project.

It isn't the best, it isn't optimized, is it ugly? Yes. But it worked.

At least until I've updated one library for UI. Then it did not want to compile and it looks like the problem was with the thirdparty library. Sadly I did not use GitHub back then, so this is the only version of Easygine I have.

I keep it as a reminder and a milestone in my programming adventure.
